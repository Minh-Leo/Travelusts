    title: 'Weekend at Adelaide Central Market ',
    text:
      ' What could be more wonderful spending a gloomy Saturday morning at Adelaide Central Market?  <br/><br/>  Located at the heart of the City of Adelaide in almost 150 years, Central Market has a vibrant atmosphere with lots of shops, cafes, bakeries with all kinds of goodies. It is one of my favorite places to go to in the weekend, either to spend time drinking coffee and chatting with my friends, or to grab a book and read while watching people passing by. The best thing is that after all these essential morning rituals, I can just stand up and do all the groceries for the week at the same place.<br/> If you are a fan of fresh veggie, you are at the right place. There are so many shops selling fresh seasonal fruits and vegetables and if you are a master of the art of bargaining, good deals are not to be missed.<br/><br/> Another thing I enjoyed while being there is the different cuisines they have to offer. If you are a fan of porchetta in a panini or on plate with salad, Marinos is the iconic street food store you should go to. You can also find Falafel, Dim Sims, Spanish paella, Khmer street food, Turkish treats and even artisans from Latin America.<br/><br/> Adelaide Central Market is probably the best street food destination that is under one roof. In the summer, there will constantly be different festivals held during the holiday and the market has even more fun activities than ever. Imagine you can go groceries and have lunch while there is live music just around the corner. With all the colours and hustle, this is a unique South Australian experience that everyone must give a try. Many people have been telling me that even though the market is rapidly changing yet its charm chooses to remain timeless.<br/> When I was little, my mom always took me to go shop for food in the early morning at the local market. At first, I was upset because getting up early in the morning is something no child (or no one!) would much enjoy. But then I started to get used to it and actually enjoyed doing it until now. The bargain of the salesmen, the sound of the coffee machine and the trolley wheels running around, the smell of fresh vegetables or fresh bread from the bakery. All these things throw me back to sweet childhood memories in a perfect way possible.<br/><br/> I wanted to capture all these moments to somehow embrace the memories I had with my mom hoping that she will know how much I value time when I was with her all day all weekend.',

    title: 'Nights in Istanbul',
    text:
      'No words could describe how much we love Istanbul in night time when streetlight goes up and the people goes out. Strolling through the narrow streets and lanes in Beyoglu, we enjoyed our evening just by looking at the hustle and bustle atmosphere and energy this place had to offer. İstiklal Caddesi was packed with people. Some are in a rush for a date at restaurants, some just stopped to watch a street performance, some are enjoying the very cheap and delicious dolma - Turkish street food - around the corner, some are like us, standing beside the lane and just watching the movement of the night. The historical tram runs through the center of Istiklal all the way to Taksim Square and that was where we wanted to head to. So we jumped on the tram. We were both quick to agree to pick the window seats so we could keep watching the view over the window. Nights like this are rare and we want to save all these moments for ourselves. <br/><br/> As a growing-up dream, to visit Turkey is one crazy adventure that we always had and were lucky to be doing this together. We tend to be most-of-the-time thinkers and wanderers. Sometimes we think a lot when we wander and sometimes we wander in our thoughts. To find someone that you feel safe enough to let them wander in your thoughts is one precious thing that I have learned to appreciate. <br/><br/> On the other side of Istanbul, along the water line, is Ortakoy. In Ortakoy, we found a mosque. The mosque with one of the most beautiful ceilings we have ever seen. It was evening time, so the light goes up, showed us its awe beauty. We visited the mosque when it was almost praying time so unfortunately we could only five minutes to take some photos before got kicked out. We blended ourselves into the crowded of Ortakoy once again until we saw this amazing view of the Bosphorus bridge. Everybody was already there for the spectacular sunset view but we still made it on time. On the other side of the bridge is Dolmabahce Palace. It is so big in white that you can see it from anywhere from this side of the river. <br/><br/> It got dark. We decided to take the ferry and went to the East side of Istanbul - Kadikoy for dinner. Waiting for us on the other side was this delicious and aromatic food smell in the air even before our ferry came to land. IT IS BALIK EKMEK. I don’t think I can ever forget this name. With all the walking back-and-forth in the city, I don’t remember what had woken up all my senses like that balik smell. The smell came from some small vendors along the dock that were grilling fresh caught fish to make ready for one iconic Turkish street food - Balik Ekmek. Balik Ekmek is sandwich with filet of fried or grilled fish (typically mackerel, or other similar oily fish), served along with various vegetables and sauces, inside a bun of Turkish bread. It took 4 balik to please our stomach that night and those are one good night memories that reminds us to this day how happy to travel and explore new things while you can.',

    title: "Adelaide's Coastline",
    text:
      'Climbing up and down the hill just to watch the sunset all over again and again. Moving to Adelaide was unexpected, yet an awe-inspiring journey for us. We learned to love the tranquil and calm atmosphere this city has been giving us. Surrounded by a breathtaking wide open spaces of coastline, its sunset is something we never want to miss when heading out to the beach. The mixing sky colours like cotton candy. The soft white sea waves. The signature salty smell of seaweed at Semaphore. The coastline is special in a way that all the trails not only walk us down to the sand, but also shape the sea view we get to witness.<br/><br/> Tiptoeing along the beach will take you to another dimension where soft sand replaced concrete ground and where the sky replaced the dark grey roofs. Only if you are lucky enough to have felt that immersing feeling only the earth can transform itself to you. Not all busy and hustling as other parts of Australia, Adelaide has taught us to listen to our within self, to touch our truth root as a human and most importantly, to reconnect with nature. ',

    title: 'Inspirational Travel Quotes by Alain De Botton',
    text:
      "Moving from places to places has been a pleasure for me ever since I grew old enough to travel by myself. A box of flight ticket collection, a passport full of visa stamps, and millions of stories of thousands of miles across North America, Asia, Oceania and a tiny bit of Europe have gradually defined a part of my identity among my surroundings - friends and family. Of course, the stories I brought back usually relate fun, surprising, the-awe-moment and happy memories that would inspire others to pursue the same lifestyles as me. Of course, there were moments of solitude, of tiredness, of culture shock, of embarrassment and tons of other many real-life things that would turn away all the excitement. However, I (we) tend to remember the signature, the new discovery, the “highlight” of it all after the trip. We always remember that sublime moment when the sunrise meets our eyes with hundreds of hot air balloons flying across the sky, but not the wake-up-at 3-am-to catch-it. We remember that “summer fling” we met on the trip to Italy, but not the sad goodbye at the end and the long 6 hours train back home, yes, alone. <br/>Through COVID-19, I sometimes found myself lost in piece-by-piece memories - the smells, the views, the sounds, the tastes - of all the places I set my foot on, and Alain De Botton’s The Art of Travel has appeared as a treasure for me. Like a lost child has found her golden compass. I see myself in many words Alain wrote. Questions that I have long yet looked for an answer, are now countered. <br/> Here are some of my favourite quotes in the book: <br/><br/> “Journeys are the midwives of thought. Few places are more conducive to internal conversations than moving planes, ships or trains.”<br/><br/>“There is psychological pleasure in this takeoff, too, for the swiftness of the plane’s ascent is an exemplary symbol of transformation. The display of power can inspire us to imagine analogous, decisive shifts in our own lives, to imagine that we, too, might one day surge above much that now looms over us.”<br/><br/>“A dominant impulse on encountering beauty is to wish to hold on to it, to possess it and give it weight in one’s life. There is an urge to say, ‘I was here, I saw this and it mattered to me.”<br/><br/>“We are inundated with advice on where to travel to, but we hear little of why and how we should go, even though the art of travel seems naturally to sustain a number of questions neither so simple nor so trivial, and whose study might in modest ways contribute to an understanding of what the Greek philosophers beautifully termed eudaimonia, or ‘human flourishing’.”<br/><br/>“If it is true that love is the pursuit in another of qualities we lack in ourselves, then in our love of someone from another culture, one ambition may be to weld ourselves more closely to values missing from our own culture.”<br/><br/>“A danger of travel is that we see things at the wrong time, before we have had a chance to build up the necessary receptivity and when new information is therefore as useless and fugitive as necklace beads without a connecting chain.”<br/><br/>“The sole cause of a man's unhappiness is that he does not know how to stay quietly in his room.”<br/><br/>“It is not necessarily at home that we best encounter our true selves. The furniture insists that we cannot change because it does not; the domestic setting keeps us tethered to the person we are in ordinary life, who may not be who we essentially are.”<br/><br/>“The pleasure we derive from journeys is perhaps dependent more on the mindset with which we travel than on the destination we travel to.”<br/><br/>“It seemed an advantage to be traveling alone. Our responses to the world are crucially moulded by the company we keep, for we temper our curiosity to fit in with the expectations of others...Being closely observed by a companion can also inhibit our observation of others; then, too, we may become caught up in adjusting ourselves to the companion's questions and remarks, or feel the need to make ourselves seem more normal than is good for our curiosity.”<br/><br/>“See how small your are next to the mountains. Accept what is bigger that you and what you do not understand. The world may appear illogical to you, but it does not follow that it is illogical per se. Our life is not the measure of all things: consider sublime places a reminder of human insignificance and frailty.” ",
