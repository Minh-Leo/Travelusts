    title: "Weekend at Adelaide Central Market ",
    text:
      " What could be more wonderful spending a gloomy Saturday morning at Adelaide Central Market?  <br/><br/>  Located at the heart of the City of Adelaide in almost 150 years, Central Market has a vibrant atmosphere with lots of shops, cafes, bakeries with all kinds of goodies. It is one of my favorite places to go to in the weekend, either to spend time drinking coffee and chatting with my friends, or to grab a book and read while watching people passing by. The best thing is that after all these essential morning rituals, I can just stand up and do all the groceries for the week at the same place.<br/> If you are a fan of fresh veggie, you are at the right place. There are so many shops selling fresh seasonal fruits and vegetables and if you are a master of the art of bargaining, good deals are not to be missed.<br/><br/> Another thing I enjoyed while being there is the different cuisines they have to offer. If you are a fan of porchetta in a panini or on plate with salad, Marinos is the iconic street food store you should go to. You can also find Falafel, Dim Sims, Spanish paella, Khmer street food, Turkish treats and even artisans from Latin America.<br/><br/> Adelaide Central Market is probably the best street food destination that is under one roof. In the summer, there will constantly be different festivals held during the holiday and the market has even more fun activities than ever. Imagine you can go groceries and have lunch while there is live music just around the corner. With all the colours and hustle, this is a unique South Australian experience that everyone must give a try. Many people have been telling me that even though the market is rapidly changing yet its charm chooses to remain timeless.<br/> When I was little, my mom always took me to go shop for food in the early morning at the local market. At first, I was upset because getting up early in the morning is something no child (or no one!) would much enjoy. But then I started to get used to it and actually enjoyed doing it until now. The bargain of the salesmen, the sound of the coffee machine and the trolley wheels running around, the smell of fresh vegetables or fresh bread from the bakery. All these things throw me back to sweet childhood memories in a perfect way possible.<br/><br/> I wanted to capture all these moments to somehow embrace the memories I had with my mom hoping that she will know how much I value time when I was with her all day all weekend.",

    title: "Nights in Istanbul",
    text:
      "No words could describe how much we love Istanbul in night time when streetlight goes up and the people goes out. Strolling through the narrow streets and lanes in Beyoglu, we enjoyed our evening just by looking at the hustle and bustle atmosphere and energy this place had to offer. İstiklal Caddesi was packed with people. Some are in a rush for a date at restaurants, some just stopped to watch a street performance, some are enjoying the very cheap and delicious dolma - Turkish street food - around the corner, some are like us, standing beside the lane and just watching the movement of the night. The historical tram runs through the center of Istiklal all the way to Taksim Square and that was where we wanted to head to. So we jumped on the tram. We were both quick to agree to pick the window seats so we could keep watching the view over the window. Nights like this are rare and we want to save all these moments for ourselves. <br/><br/> As a growing-up dream, to visit Turkey is one crazy adventure that we always had and were lucky to be doing this together. We tend to be most-of-the-time thinkers and wanderers. Sometimes we think a lot when we wander and sometimes we wander in our thoughts. To find someone that you feel safe enough to let them wander in your thoughts is one precious thing that I have learned to appreciate. <br/><br/> On the other side of Istanbul, along the water line, is Ortakoy. In Ortakoy, we found a mosque. The mosque with one of the most beautiful ceilings we have ever seen. It was evening time, so the light goes up, showed us its awe beauty. We visited the mosque when it was almost praying time so unfortunately we could only five minutes to take some photos before got kicked out. We blended ourselves into the crowded of Ortakoy once again until we saw this amazing view of the Bosphorus bridge. Everybody was already there for the spectacular sunset view but we still made it on time. On the other side of the bridge is Dolmabahce Palace. It is so big in white that you can see it from anywhere from this side of the river. <br/><br/> It got dark. We decided to take the ferry and went to the East side of Istanbul - Kadikoy for dinner. Waiting for us on the other side was this delicious and aromatic food smell in the air even before our ferry came to land. IT IS BALIK EKMEK. I don’t think I can ever forget this name. With all the walking back-and-forth in the city, I don’t remember what had woken up all my senses like that balik smell. The smell came from some small vendors along the dock that were grilling fresh caught fish to make ready for one iconic Turkish street food - Balik Ekmek. Balik Ekmek is sandwich with filet of fried or grilled fish (typically mackerel, or other similar oily fish), served along with various vegetables and sauces, inside a bun of Turkish bread. It took 4 balik to please our stomach that night and those are one good night memories that reminds us to this day how happy to travel and explore new things while you can.",

    title: "Adelaide's Coastline",
    text:
      "Climbing up and down the hill just to watch the sunset all over again and again. Moving to Adelaide was unexpected, yet an awe-inspiring journey for us. We learned to love the tranquil and calm atmosphere this city has been giving us. Surrounded by a breathtaking wide open spaces of coastline, its sunset is something we never want to miss when heading out to the beach. The mixing sky colours like cotton candy. The soft white sea waves. The signature salty smell of seaweed at Semaphore. The coastline is special in a way that all the trails not only walk us down to the sand, but also shape the sea view we get to witness.<br/><br/> Tiptoeing along the beach will take you to another dimension where soft sand replaced concrete ground and where the sky replaced the dark grey roofs. Only if you are lucky enough to have felt that immersing feeling only the earth can transform itself to you. Not all busy and hustling as other parts of Australia, Adelaide has taught us to listen to our within self, to touch our truth root as a human and most importantly, to reconnect with nature. ",
