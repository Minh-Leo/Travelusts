      " What could be more wonderful spending a gloomy Saturday morning at Adelaide Central Market?  <br/><br/>  Located at the heart of the City of Adelaide in almost 150 years, Central Market has a vibrant atmosphere with lots of shops, cafes, bakeries with all kinds of goodies. It is one of my favorite places to go to in the weekend, either to spend time drinking coffee and chatting with my friends, or to grab a book and read while watching people passing by. The best thing is that after all these essential morning rituals, I can just stand up and do all the groceries for the week at the same place.<br/> If you are a fan of fresh veggie, you are at the right place. There are so many shops selling fresh seasonal fruits and vegetables and if you are a master of the art of bargaining, good deals are not to be missed.<br/> Another thing I enjoyed while being there is the different cuisines they have to offer. If you are a fan of porchetta in a panini or on plate with salad, Marinos is the iconic street food store you should go to. You can also find Falafel, Dim Sims, Spanish paella, Khmer street food, Turkish treats and even artisans from Latin America.<br/> Adelaide Central Market is probably the best street food destination that is under one roof. In the summer, there will constantly be different festivals held during the holiday and the market has even more fun activities than ever. Imagine you can go groceries and have lunch while there is live music just around the corner. With all the colours and hustle, this is a unique South Australian experience that everyone must give a try. Many people have been telling me that even though the market is rapidly changing yet its charm chooses to remain timeless.<br/> When I was little, my mom always took me to go shop for food in the early morning at the local market. At first, I was upset because getting up early in the morning is something no child (or no one!) would much enjoy. But then I started to get used to it and actually enjoyed doing it until now. The bargain of the salesmen, the sound of the coffee machine and the trolley wheels running around, the smell of fresh vegetables or fresh bread from the bakery. All these things throw me back to sweet childhood memories in a perfect way possible.<br/> I wanted to capture all these moments to somehow embrace the memories I had with my mom hoping that she will know how much I value time when I was with her all day all weekend.",
